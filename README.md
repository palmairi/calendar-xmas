Christmas Calendar
=======

About the project
-----------

This is the digital version of the classic advent calendar, which usually gives you chocolate or other tiny presents.
It has a desktop view and a mobile view with different features and layout.
The project was made with `ReactJS and tailwindCSS` for styling the layouts and the components.

It was important to me during this project:
* to make it somewhat responsive, while using grid layout
* to implement microinteractions to make it more lively
* to use reuseable components

How to run the project
-----------
1. Clone it from Github
2. Open the project folder in a terminal
3. npm i
4. npm run start (to start the project on localhost:3000)
5. On the login page the password is written on top of the input field
